# Hiring Blocks

Hiring Blocks is a platform for companies to hire their candidates as well as for candidates to find jobs in the blockchain. We are aiming to decentralize the project partially using IPFS, by storing the static content on the website and retrieving it from IPFS. The static content will include images, resumes, profiles of companies, logos, profiles of candidates etc.

## Technical Overview

We are using javascript frameworks, reactjs for the frontend and nodejs for the backend. We are planning to use web3.storage for IPFS storage for assets.

## Features Implemented

- A landing page for our users
- A jobs dashboard to upload job postings for companies
- Logins for users to check the status of their application
- IPFS uploads for user profiles, company profiles and resume
- No paywal for candidates or companies as of now
- Logins and profile mapping through address

To explore and work on more ways to make the application decentralized
